-----------------

**Bansoko** is a reimagined, space-themed clone of MS-DOS Soko-Ban from 1984 created in Python using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).

> *Welcome to Bansoko!*
> 
> *You are a scavenger. You collect cargos that people have left in abandoned ships in deep space.*
> *It's a dangerous job, that's why we're using robots.*
> 
> *Your goal is to use a remotely controlled robot to push all crates to cargo bays.*
> *Remember, you can only **push** them (you cannot **pull**)*
> *Fortunately, in case of mistake you can undo as many steps as you need.*
> 
> *Good luck!*
